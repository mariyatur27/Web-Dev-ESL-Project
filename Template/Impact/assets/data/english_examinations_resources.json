    "Tip": "If you have not been in a Canadian educational institution for more than four years, consider taking one of the tests below as they are requisite for universities/colleges. ESL years are sometimes NOT considered to be one of the four years(For example, University of Waterloo), make sure you contact your post-secondary institutions to make sure.(Can be put on the website if you guys want to add some clarification)."
